#' Motion detector for Ethocope data
#'
#' Defines whether a *single animal* is moving according to:
#'
#' * Validated and corrected subpixel velocity ([max_velocity_detector]), the most rigorous
#' * Uncorrected subpixel velocity ([max_velocity_detector_legacy])
#' * Crossing a virtual beam in the middle of the region of interest ([virtual_beam_cross_detector])
#'
#' [max_velocity_detector] is the default movement classification for real-time ethoscope experiments.
#' It is benchmarked against human-generated ground truth.
#' @name motion_detectors
#' @param data [data.table::data.table] containing behavioural variables of *a single animal* (no id).
#' It must have the columns `xy_dist_log10x1000`(for computing subpixel velocity),
#' `x`(beam cross), `t` and `has_interacted` (whether a stimulus was delivered).
#' @param velocity_correction_coef an empirical coefficient to correct velocity with respect
#'  to variable framerate.
#' @inheritParams sleep_annotation
#' @inheritParams prepare_data_for_motion_detector
#' @param masking_duration number of seconds during which any movement is ignored (velocity is set to 0) after
#' a stimulus is delivered (a.k.a. interaction).
#' @param velocity_threshold uncorrected velocity above which an animal is classified as `moving' (for the legacy version).
#' @return an object of the same type as `data` (i.e. [data.table::data.table] or [behavr::behavr])  with additional columns:
#' * `moving` Logical, TRUE iff. motion was detected.
#' * `beam_crosses` The number of beam crosses
#' (when the animal crosses x = 0.5 -- that is the midpoint of the region of interest) within the time window
#' * `max_velocity` The maximal velocity within the time window.
#' The resulting data is sampled at a period equals to `time_window_length`.
#' @details
#'  These functions are *rarely called directly*, but typically used is in the context of [sleep_annotation].
#' @seealso
#' * [sleep_annotation] -- which requieres a motion detector
